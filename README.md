**Technical Details**


💡 **Why It Exists**

Current gym apps tend to be cluttered, slow, and not optimized for real-world gym conditions. This app solves that by focusing on:

⚡️ Fast, offline-first performance

👍 One-thumb operation

🧼 Minimalist, sweat-friendly interface

👀 Instant glanceability

🧠 Low cognitive load logging

♿️ Accessibility and adaptability for all users

🔍 **Current Focus**

The current development phase is laser-focused on building a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that directly addresses the biggest pain points gym-goers face in real-world conditions—sweaty hands, spotty internet, limited mental bandwidth, and the need for speed and clarity between sets.

This MVP prioritizes core usability over features, ensuring that logging workouts becomes frictionless, fast, and reliable—even offline. Key design goals include:

- One-tap set logging with auto-fill from previous workout history and instant progress

- Local-first, offline-first architecture that never blocks user actions

- Built-in progress feedback, from total weight volume to total sets completed

- One-hand-friendly UI, with thumb-reachable buttons and dark mode

- Accessibility and privacy by default, including no third-party tracking

By focusing on speed, resilience, and clarity, the app aims to become the most dependable workout companion in your pocket—always ready, never in the way.
